# Priv@teFit

Priv@teFit is an open-source private wellness app that allows consumers to share health data with each other through a peer-to-peer encrypted connection built on the @platform. Born at HackPrinceton 2021 and created by Raheem Idowu, and Michelle Liu. This project originated as a winning project from the hackathon.
Priv@teFit hopes to offer features like:

> 1. Message your health community polymorphically, with your fitness trainer, your workout pals, and your healthy diet friends.
- Share your fitness trainer data that only he or she can view.
- Share your fitness routine data that only certain friends can view.
- Share your diet plan data only with a few trusted pals.

> 2. Privately monitor your daily activity, sports and workout routine, and calories.
- Retract that data and info when you want.
- Modify that data and info when you want.

> 3. Reason over your own data without Big Data companies getting access or forcing you down AI paths that just donâ€™t fit who you really are.
